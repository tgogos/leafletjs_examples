Most basic example, provides code on how initialize a map and then add `markers`, `circle` and a `polyline` (path).

## demo.html

This example adds some more features:

 - `markers` that are updating their position (like moving on a predifined path)
 - grouping things together to `layers`

## generate_routes.html

This is a small tool that calculates (`latitude`,`longitude`) pairs. As the user keeps clicking on the map, the tool generates all the points that cover that distances (in straight lines) by using a `1-meter` step. With this approach, one can generate cyclic paths on the map and later add `markers` that move at `X` m/sec.
